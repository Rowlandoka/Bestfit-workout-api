# Getting Started with Bestfit-workout-api

As part of the final requirement and to mark the end of a glorious journey into the world of software engineering with ALX, I would be building a REST API for a BestFit Training Application. It is a competitive sport that combine high-intensity daily workouts with elements from several sports. I would seek to fully implement the CRUD functionality such as Create, Read, Update and Delete WOD's - (Workouts Of the Day). This is aimed at helping users such as gym owners develop daily workout plans and maintain their own workouts inside a single application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/workouts](http://localhost:3000/workouts) to view it in the browser.
